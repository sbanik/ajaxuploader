ajaxuploader
============

A file upload plugin which uploads a file and shows the progress in a HTML5 progress bar. Every file to be uploaded has its own progress bar. The plugin exploits the xhr option of the $.ajax() function hence it is possible to attach a separate progress bar for each file upload. Besides the files are uploaded one by one.
