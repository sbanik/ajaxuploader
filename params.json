Every file to be uploaded has its own progress bar which displays the progress of every file being uploaded.</p>\r\n<p>The plugin exploits the xhr option of the $.ajax() function of the jQuery library. Hence it is possible to attach a separate progress bar for each file upload. Besides the files are uploaded one by one by looping through the file array extracted by javascript.It is seen to be compatible with Mozilla Firefox v23.0.1 and in Chrome Version 29.0.1547.62</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Check out a demo this plugin here in my website <a href=\"http://baniksite.byethost7.com/ajaxuploader/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</h4>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
